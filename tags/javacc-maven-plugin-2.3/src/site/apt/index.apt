Maven 2 JavaCC Plugin

  This plugin uses the {{{http://javacc.dev.java.net/} JavaCC}} parser generator to process JavaCC 
  grammar files and generate the appropriate Java source files.  For general information about JavaCC, 
  see the {{{http://javacc.dev.java.net/} JavaCC}} web site.

  JavaCC grammar files use the extension <<<.jj>>>.  This plugin can be used to locate and 
  process all grammar files within a specified directory.  Java source files will be written to a common 
  generated-sources output directory, typically located in the build output directory.  By default, 
  the plugin will run during the <<<generate-sources>>> phase, but it can be configured to run in other 
  phases as well.
  
  The plugin can also be be used to call the JJTree and JTB tools.  JJTree is a preprocessor for JavaCC 
  that inserts parse tree building actions at various places in the JavaCC source. More information 
  about JJTree can be found on the {{{http://javacc.dev.java.net/} JavaCC}} site.
   
  JTB (Java Tree Builder) is a syntax tree builder.  More information about JTB can be found on the 
  {{{http://compilers.cs.ucla.edu/jtb/} JTB}} web site.
  
  This plugin also contains a mojo for running JJDoc.  JJDoc is a simple tool that generates 
  {{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form} BNF }} documentation for the JavaCC 
  grammar files.  This can be used to generate a report for your project site using the Maven
  reporting tools.
   
* Goals Overview

  * {{{javacc-mojo.html}javacc:javacc}} This mojo uses JavaCC to process <<<.jj>>> grammar files and generate a java parser.
  
  * {{{jjtree-mojo.html}javacc:jjtree}} This mojo uses JJTree to process <<<.jjt>>> files and generate <<<.jj>>> files.
  
  * {{{jtb-mojo.html}javacc:jtb}} This mojo uses JTB to process <<<.jtb>>> files and generate <<<.jj>>> files.
  
  * {{{jjdoc-mojo.html}javacc:jjdoc}} This mojo is used to create a JJDoc site report.
   
* Usage

  This plugin is normally used before Java compilation, during the <<<generate-sources>>> phase of a build.  
  Detailed instructions on how to use the JavaCC Maven Plugin can be found on the {{{usage.html}usage}} page.

* Examples

  Below is a basic example of configuring your project build to use the JavaCC mojo.  More examples can be found 
  using the links in the menu.
