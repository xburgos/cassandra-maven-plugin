Maven2 JavaNCSS Plugin
 
  {{{http://www.kclee.de/clemens/java/javancss/}JavaNCSS}} is a source measurement suite for Java which produces quantity & complexity metrics for your java source code.

  This plugin provides the capability to run the JavaNCSS tool on your Maven 2 project sources and produce an html report.
  Optionally you can fail the build whenever one of the metrics goes beyond a fixed limit.
   
  Many thanks to Clemens Lee and the many contributors to the JavaNCSS project for producing this tool for all to use.
