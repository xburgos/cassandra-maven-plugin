Usage

  This plugin offers goals for checking whether the current version of your
  project is binary compatible with previous versions and for generating a report.

* {Compatibility checks}

  The <<<clirr:check>>> goal is used to check for compatibility with
  previous versions. To use this goal, add a section like the
  following to your POM:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<project>
  <build>
    <plugins>
      ...
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>
        <artifactId>clirr-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
      </plugin>
      ...
    </plugins>
  </build>
</project>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Generating a report

  The plugin can also be used to add a report to the generated site.
  If you'd like to have a Clirr report, add a section like this to
  your POM:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<project>
  <reporting>
    <plugins>
      ...
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>
        <artifactId>clirr-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
      </plugin>
      ...
    </plugins>
  </reporting>
</project>
