      <question>Does the plugin work on a non-Solaris platform?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          The short answer is probably not.
        </p>
        <p>
          The a bit longer answer is that it will only run on platforms that have the <code>pkgmk</code> and
          <code>pkgtrans</code> tools installed in PATH. If you're on a platform without these tools installed
          natively you can try to install the tools from the <a href="http://heirloom.sourceforge.net/">Heirloom</a>
          project.
        </p>
        <p>
          It wouldn't be very hard to implement a basic version of these
          tools in plain java, but it will take a bit of effort and not least testing. See the
          <a href="developers.html">Developers</a> page for more information about how to develop the plugin and
          specification of the package data stream format.
