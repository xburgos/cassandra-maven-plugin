<!-- I'm pretty sure people already know why they would like to create Solaris package so I feel that this section
is a bit too much.
    <section name="Why?">
      <p>
        For many projects, especially in business, the build-process is not intended to end with a binary artifact (jar,
        war, etc.) or universal distribution. Further there is the need for a configuration-management that is able to
        build deployment packages for the targeted operating system in a precise and reproduceable way.
      </p>
      <p>
        These packages allow to install, update and uninstall the software in an automated and ordered way. Further the
        packaging allows to controll installation dependencies and custom scripts for installation and deinstallation
        e.g. to ensure that an installed service is restarted after a reboot.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additional needs in this context are to separate a single application into different deployment packages. E.g.
        if the configuration (that may be specific for the target machine) is separated into an extra package, the
        deployment package for the actual software can be tested in a test-environment. After successful quality
        assurance the same package can go in production without further customization.
      </p>

    <section name="Requirements">
      <p>
        The solaris-maven-plugin requires that the pkg-tools (pkgmk and pkgtrans) for solaris are installed and
        in your PATH.
