Source Parameters

  The parameters described in this page specify the set of files to be copied
  into the work area for inclusion in the RPM package.  By default, files which
  are related to source control and editor temporary files are excluded.

  The set of parameters which define a single file set are contained within a
  <<<source>>> tag.  The set of all <<<source>>> tags are contained within
  a <<<sources>>> tag.  A minimal source configuration looks like:

<plugin>

    <mappings>
      <mapping>
        ...
        <sources>
          <source>
            <location>target/classes</location>
          </source>
        </sources>
        ...
      </mapping>
    </mappings>
    ...
  </configuration>
  ...
</plugin>

* {location} (<<required>>)

  The file or directory to include.  If a directory is specified, all files
  and subdirectories are also included.  If the path does not start with
  <<</>>>, it is taken to be relative to the project's base directory.

  Note that the entire source specification is optional, but each source
  specification that is present must have this parameter.

* {noDefaultExcludes}

  If given the value <<<true>>>, the default exclusions are not used.

* {includes}

  Contains one or more <<<include>>> elements with a wildcard filename
  expression which identifies the files to be included.

* {excludes}

  Contains one or more <<<exclude>>> elements with a wildcard filename
  expression which identifies the files to be excluded.  If
  <<<noDefaultExcludes>>> is not specified, the default exclusions are added
  to this list.
