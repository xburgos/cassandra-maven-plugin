     <question>Is there an easy way to generate the aggregate report ?</question>
     <answer>
       <p>
       Unfortunately Maven's internal support for report aggregation
  is rather poor so it does have a number of limitations.  Foremost the aggregate report is generated <b>before</b> the child
  reports so you must re-run the JavaNCSS report after the children have generated, like this:
      </p>
      <p>
<code>mvn clean site</code> (generate the site for every module recursively)<br/>
<code>mvn javancss:report</code> (re-run the JavaNCSS report recursively so the aggregate report works)<br/>
       </p>
