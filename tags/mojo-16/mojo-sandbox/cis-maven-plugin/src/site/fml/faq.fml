      <answer>
        <p>The <a href="http://www.softwareag.com/Corporate/products/cv/appldes/default.asp">
          Crossvision Application Designer</a> is a GUI builder for web applications based

    <faq id="Casabac">
      <question>What is Casabac?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>The Crossvision Application Designer was originally developed by a small
          company named Casabac. This name was shared by both company and product.</p>
        <p>Later on, the company was acquired by <a href="http://www.softwareag.com">
          Software AG</a> and the product emerged into a part of the SOA suite
          Crossvision. The Crossvision Application Composer, a similar product with
          the emphasis on use of web services, rather than Java code, was developed out of
          the Application Designer.</p>

    <faq id="CIS">
      <question>What does the abbreviation CIS mean?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>The abbreviation is for <code>Composite Integrator Server</code>. Casabac
          (the product) was renamed to CIS, after Casabac (the company) was acquired
          by Software AG. Later on, the product was renamed again to
          <code>Crossvision Application Designer</code>.</p>
        <p>The application designers jar files are still using the package name
          <code>com.softwareag.cis</code>, which is why the plugin was named
          <code>Maven CIS Plugin</code>, and not, for example, Maven Application
          Designer Plugin.</p>

      <question>How do I add my own servlets, filters, resources, or mappings to <file>WEB-INF/web.xml</file>?</question>

          in <file>src/main/cis/<code>MyApplication</code>/web.xml</file>. The Maven CIS
          Plugin will merge your settings into the generated war files <file>web.xml</file>.

      <question>How do I add my own startup code to the web application?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>The <code>Crossvision Application Designer</code> provides an interface
          named <code>com.softwareag.cis.server.IServletInitHandler</code>.
          Implementations of this class may be added to the application designers
          initialization phase by declaring them as a <code>startApp</code> in
          the CIS applications configuration. See <a href="examples/cisApplications.html">
