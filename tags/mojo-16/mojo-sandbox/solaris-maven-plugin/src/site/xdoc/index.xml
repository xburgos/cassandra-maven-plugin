    <section name="About">
      <p>The solaris-maven-plugin creates a system-V package
      from a maven project that can be used to deploy your
      software on a SunOS/Solaris system.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section name="Why?">
      <p>For many projects, especially in business, the build-process
      is not intended to end with a binary artifact (jar, war, etc.) 
      or universal distribution. Further there is the need for a 
      configuration-management that is able to build deployment 
      packages for the targeted operating system in a precise 
      and reproduceable way.</p>
      <p>These packages allow to install, update and uninstall the 
      software in an automated and ordered way. Further the packaging 
      allows to controll installation dependencies and custom scripts
      for installation and deinstallation e.g. to ensure that an installed
      service is restarted after a reboot.
      </p>
      <p>Additional needs in this context are to separate a single
      application into different deployment packages. E.g. if the
      configuration (that may be specific for the target machine)
      is separated into an extra package, the deployment package for the actual software
      can be tested in a test-environment. After successful quality
      assurance the same package can go in production without 
      further customization.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section name="Requirements">
      <p>The solaris-maven-plugin requires that the pkg-tools 
      (pkgproto, pkgtrans, pkgmk) for solaris are installed and in 
      your PATH. The plugin is written as ant-target that calls 
      the pkg-tools as external process. Therefore it is not 
      possible to run the plugin on a plattform where pkg-tools 
      are not available.
      </p>
      <p>If someone knows the specification of system-V packages and 
      sees a way how to legally create those in pure java with code 
      compatible to the apache software license please contribute.
