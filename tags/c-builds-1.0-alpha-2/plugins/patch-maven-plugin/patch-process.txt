Patch process outline

X 0. If patch plugin is disabled (config: <disabled>false</disabled>) then disable 
all patch steps

X 1. Check for patch artifact given current POM info (version, etc.)

X 2. If patch artifact was resolved, unpack it and set a flag for existing patch
  artifact being found. Set the patch source dir to the unpack location.

X 3. If patch artifact was not resolved, set the patch source dir to the
  configured source directory (src/patches by default).

x 4. Apply all patch files in the patch-source directory. Require an ordering
list, and allow specification of strict-follow, to fail the build if all
specified patches are not present.

x 5. If the patch artifact was not resolved, this is a new project. Create the
patch-archive artifact, and attach it to the project artifact for
installation/deployment.

x 6. When installing the project artifact, go back and delete the patch artifact
from the local repository, so we can detect when the patch artifact is actually
deployed for the first time...we'll need this to keep from installing the patch
artifact locally, then never deploying it again (since it'll resolve from then
on).
