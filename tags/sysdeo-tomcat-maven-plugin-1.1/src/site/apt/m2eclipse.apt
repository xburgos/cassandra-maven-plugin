Using m2eclipse 

  0.9.4 and later versions of m2eclipse will execute the sysdeo-tomcat-maven-plugin as part of the Update 
  Configuration task.
  A dedicated mojo is used, to support some tiny differences between command line maven and m2eclipse, but the
  configuration is the same :

  <<Step One:>> Add the plugin to your web application's
  <<<pom.xml>>> :  
  
+--- 
  <plugin>
    <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>
    <artifactId>sysdeo-tomcat-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>1.1</version>
  </plugin>
+---

  <<Step Two:>> After doing this, m2eclipse will configure the eclipse sysdeo tomcat plugin based on the
  dependencies declared in your project's <<<pom.xml>>> and projects available in the workspace.
