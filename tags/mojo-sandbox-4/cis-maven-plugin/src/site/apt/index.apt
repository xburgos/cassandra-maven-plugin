           ----------------

The Maven CIS Plugin

  This plugin is for users of the
  {{{http://www.softwareag.com/Corporate/products/cv/appldes/default.asp}
  Crossvision Application Designer}} (CAD). It allows to create CAD
  applications in a controlled and clean build process, which is recommended
  for modern applications, by using Maven 2.

* Goals Overview

  The Maven CIS Plugin is implemented by "subclassing" the Maven War Plugin.
  Consequently, it inherits the latter plugins goals:

  * cis:war is the default goal invoked during the package phase for projects
    with a packaging of cis.
  * cis:exploded is generally used to speed up testing during the developement
    phase by creating an exploded war in a specified directory.
  * cis:inplace another variation of the cis:explode where the war is instead
    generated in the web source directory which is src/main/webapp by default.

* Usage

  Instructions on how to use the XML Maven Plugin can be found {{{usage.html}here}}.
