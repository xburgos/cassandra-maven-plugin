Repository Tools

  This plugin provides tools to manage repositories. More specifically, adding new artifacts to repositories
  by copying from other repositories, using artifact bundles, ...


1. Merging repositories

	This plugin copies artifacts by resolving them from a source repo to a temporary local repo,
	and then deploying the artifacts in that local repo to the target repo. There are a few ways
	to do this:

	* In two steps: 

	** Build a local repo: <repositorytools:add-artifact> downloads a specific artifact to the local repo. This
	can be repeated for more than one artifact. <repositorytools:add-plugin-group> resolves an entire plugin group
	(e.g. org.apache.maven.plugins). 

	** Deploy the local repo: <repositorytools:deploy-repository>  can be used to upload an entire local repository.

	* In one step: <repositorytools:copy-artifact> directly copies artifacts from a source to a target repo.
	Behind the screens, a temporary local repo is used - by default a subdirectory 'local' of the current directory.
	Make sure it is empty before using the goal.

2. Deploying bundles

	To upload artifact bundles like the ones created by the repository-plugin, use the <repositorytools:deploy-bundle> goal.
	This type of bundle contains the main artifact and attached artifacts in the root of the bundle jar. Apart from that,
	the goal also supports using a zipped up repository as a bundle containing multiple artifacts.
	
	<Note: only the zipped up repository is currently implemented.>
	
3. Validating bundles

	<repositorytools:validate-artifact> performes some validation on an artifact in a local or remote
	repository. 
	
4. Scenario's

	* Staging repositories:
	Before a release vote, artifacts are deployed to a staging repo. If the vote passes,
	the entire repository is deployed to the target repo.

	* Upload requests: 
	Users upload a bundle to some kind of ticketing system. The repository administrator validates
	the POM and deploys it to the repository.

	* Copy requests for corporate repo's:
	A corporate repo is not automatically synced with central. Only artifacts that are approved are
	put into the repo by copying them from their original repo, or by uploading bundles.
