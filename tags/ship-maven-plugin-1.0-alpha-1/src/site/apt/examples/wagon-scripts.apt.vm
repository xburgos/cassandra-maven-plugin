Wagon Scripts

  There is a basic {{{http://maven.apache.org/wagon/index.html}Apache Maven Wagon}} script engine that allows pushing
  artifacts to URLs.

  The script engine works for all ship scripts that end with <<<.wagon>>>.

  The syntax is very basic, any lines matching the pattern:

    <<<put>>> selector-id <<<in>>> url
  or
    <<<put>>> selector-id <<<in>>> url <<<id>>> serverId

  will result in the file being transferred to the destination URL. If the URL ends in <<</>>> then the file will
  be transferred using it's default name, otherwise it will be transferred as the specified name
