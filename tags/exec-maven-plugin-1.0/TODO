Merge with execute?
-------------------

Should we merge with execute? Not sure. This plugin is about executing programs, not Java classes. 
Not only the implementation is very different, but the configuration would seem not very compatible.

Nevertheless, I've been asked several time if it could be done. If it was done, here's one way it could end up if one wants to keep the capacity of not creating a process, one has to identify the specified class. This sucks...

  <mainClass>com.domain.test.Test</mainClass>
  <arguments>
    <argument>...</argument>
    <argument>...</argument>
    <argument>...</argument>
  </arguments>

Given the configuration proposal above (for handling classpath), we would have the following notes:
- <mainClass> and <executable> mutually exclusive
- <classpath> not allowed within <arguments> when using <mainClass>
