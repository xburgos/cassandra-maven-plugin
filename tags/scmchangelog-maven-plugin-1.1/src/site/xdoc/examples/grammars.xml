      <subsection name="Operations">
        <p>
         We support currently 2 grammars:
          <ul>
            <li>MANU</li>
            <li>REMY</li>
          </ul>
          both with the same operations. The operations are <b>NOT</b> case sensitive.
          <br/>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>add</b>: when you add a new feature or some code to your projet.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>remove</b>: when you remove a feature or some code from your projet.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>update</b>: when you update a feature or some code in your projet.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>fix</b>: when you fixe a feature or some code in your projet.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>

      <subsection name="What about the issue id?">
        <p>
          Well it is quite simple, each bug tracker is associated with a pattern.  When an issue id is provided (which is <i>optionnal</i>) we use the pattern to link the entry to the tracker.
        </p>

    <section name="Grammars">
      <subsection name="MANU">
        <p>
         The <b>MANU</b> grammar uses the pattern:<source>@operation:${issueId};</source>
         So for example, to link to the bug MSCMCHGLOG-7 and you would have:</p>
        <p>
          <source>@update:MSCMCHGLOG-7;The documentation has been updated.</source>
        </p>
        <p>
         If you don't have a issue id but still want to add an entry you could use the following comment:
          <source>@fix:;The url to the JIRA tracker has been fixed.</source>
        </p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="REMY">
        <p>
         The <b>REMY</b> grammar uses the pattern: <source>[operation:${issueId}]</source>
         So for example, to link to the bug MSCMCHGLOG-7 and you would have:</p>
        <p>
          <source>[update:MSCMCHGLOG-7]The documentation has been updated.</source>
        </p>
        <p>
         If you don't have a issue id but still want to add an entry you could use the following comment:
          <source>[@fix:]The url to the JIRA tracker has been fixed.</source>
