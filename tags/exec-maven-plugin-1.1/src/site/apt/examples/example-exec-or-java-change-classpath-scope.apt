Changing the classpath scope when running Java programs

  Whether you use the java mojo or the special support of Java for the exec mojo, you might want 
  to change the scope of the plugin execution. This can be achieved using the *classpathScope* configuration element, e.g. for a test scope:

-------------------
        <configuration>
            ...
            <classpathScope>test</classpathScope>
            ...
        </configuration>
-------------------

  or, on the command line, 

-----
> mvn exec:exec [...] -Dexec.classpathScope="java"
