Basic usage

  To generate an code coverage report on demand with the default settings, just execute
  the emma:emma goal on your project:

---
mvn emma:emma
---

  To include the emma coverage report in the project site, add the following to the
  reporting section of your project:

---
<project>
  ...
  <reporting>
    ...
    <plugins>
      ...
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>
        <artifactId>emma-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
      </plugin>
      ...
    </plugins>
    ...
  </reporting>
  ...
</project>
---

  Note: best practice is to specify the version of plugins in order to ensure that your
  build is reproducible. The above example will always use the latest version of the
  emma-maven-plugin.

  To include the emma coverage report in all child projects, add the following to the
  parent project:

---
<project>
  ...
  <reporting>
    ...
    <plugins>
      ...
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>
        <artifactId>emma-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        <inherited>true</inherited>
      </plugin>
      ...
    </plugins>
    ...
  </reporting>
  ...
</project>
---
