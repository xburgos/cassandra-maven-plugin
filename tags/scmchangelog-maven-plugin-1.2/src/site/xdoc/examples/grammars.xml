      <subsection name="Operations">
        <p>
         We support currently 4 grammars:
          <ul>
            <li>MANU</li>
            <li>REMY</li>
            <li>BUGZILLA</li>
            <li>ALL</li>
          </ul>
          all with the same operations. The operations are <b>NOT</b> case sensitive.
          <br/>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>add</b>: when you add a new feature or some code to your projet.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>remove</b>: when you remove a feature or some code from your projet.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>update</b>: when you update a feature or some code in your projet.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>fix</b>: when you fixe a feature or some code in your projet.
            </li>
          </ul>

      <subsection name="What about the issue id?">
        <p>
          Well it is quite simple, each bug tracker is associated with a pattern.  When an issue id is provided (which is <i>optionnal</i>) we use the pattern to link the entry to the tracker.
        </p>

    <section name="Grammars">
      <subsection name="MANU">
        <p>
         The <b>MANU</b> grammar uses the pattern:<source>@operation:${issueId};</source>
         So for example, to link to the bug MSCMCHGLOG-7 and you would have:</p>
        <p>
          <source>@update:MSCMCHGLOG-7;The documentation has been updated.</source>
        </p>
        <p>
         If you don't have a issue id but still want to add an entry you could use the following comment:
          <source>@fix:;The url to the JIRA tracker has been fixed.</source>
        </p>
        <p>
         It's also possible to add several entries. You just have to add one entry by line as described in the following comment:
<!-- WARNING : spaces in the source node are visible in the generated html page  -->
<source>@update:MSCMCHGLOG-7;The documentation has been updated.
@fix:;The url to the JIRA tracker has been fixed.
</source>
        </p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="REMY">
        <p>
         The <b>REMY</b> grammar uses the pattern: <source>[operation:${issueId}]</source>
         So for example, to link to the bug MSCMCHGLOG-7 and you would have:</p>
        <p>
          <source>[update:MSCMCHGLOG-7]The documentation has been updated.</source>
        </p>
        <p>
         If you don't have a issue id but still want to add an entry you could use the following comment:
          <source>[fix:]The url to the JIRA tracker has been fixed.</source>
        </p>
        <p>
         It's also possible to add several entries. You just have to add one entry by line as described in the following comment:
<!-- WARNING : spaces in the source node are visible in the generated html page  -->
<source>[update:MSCMCHGLOG-7]The documentation has been updated.
[fix:]The url to the JIRA tracker has been fixed.
</source>
        </p>

      <subsection name="BUGZILLA">
        <p>The <b>BUGZILLA</b> grammar implements Bugzilla's <a href="http://www.bugzilla.org/docs/3.2/en/html/hintsandtips.html">autolinkification</a>
        feature, automatically recognizing bug references of the form:</p>
        <p>
          <source>bug 42: The documentation has been updated.</source>
        </p>
        <p>This grammar does not allow the plugin to distinguish between the various operations,
        so they will all be marked in the report as "fix".</p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="ALL">
        <p>The <b>ALL</b> grammar implements accept all comments and doesn't recognize bug references of the form:</p>
        <p>
          <source>The documentation has been updated.</source>
        </p>
        <p>This grammar does not allow the plugin to distinguish between the various operations,
