# NOTE:
# This bundle is intentionally empty because English strings are provided by the base bundle via the parent chain. It
# must be provided nevertheless such that a request for locale "en" will not errorneously pick up the bundle for the
# JVM's default locale (which need not be "en"). See the method javadoc about
#   ResourceBundle.getBundle(String, Locale, ClassLoader)
# for a full description of the lookup strategy.
