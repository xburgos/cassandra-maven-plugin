Counting Tags

  This example is meant to show you how the Taglist Maven Plugin works, when it
  finds and counts tags in your code.

  Let us configure the plugin in the <<<pom.xml>>> file like this:

-----
<project>
  ...
  <reporting>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>
        <artifactId>taglist-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>2.2</version>
        <configuration>
          <tags>
            <tag>TODO</tag>
            <tag>&lt;todo</tag>
            <tag>FIXME</tag>
            <tag>DOCUMENT_ME</tag>
            <tag>NOT_YET_DOCUMENTED</tag>
          </tags>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
      ...
    </plugins>
  </reporting>
  ...
</project>
-----

  The Java file we are analyzing is this one:

-----
 1: package taglist;
 2:
 3: /**
 4:  * NOT_YET_DOCUMENTED
 5:  */
 6: public class Issue
 7: {
 8:   /**
 9:    * A method.
10:    * FIXME Describe what this method does
11:    *
12:    * @param i DOCUMENT_ME
13:    * @return Something useful
14:    */
15:   public double method(int i)
16:   {
17:     // <todo> must be implemented
18:     return 0;
19:   }
20:
21:   /**
22:    * This method counts FIXME tags in the text.
23:    */
24:   private int countFixmeTags(String text)
25:   {
26:     // @todo Implement this later
27:   }
28: }
-----

  We'll go through the lines in the code and explain what happens and why.

  <<Line 4:>> This line will <not> be counted, because it is empty - it isn't
  followed by a desciptive text.

  <<Line 10:>> This line will be counted.

  <<Line 12:>> This line will <not> be counted, because it is located at the end
  of the line with other text before it.

  <<Line 17:>> This line will be counted.

  <<Line 22:>> This line will <not> be counted, because it appears in the middle
  of the line with other text before it.

  <<Line 26:>> This line will <not> be counted, because the text <<<@todo>>> is
  not one of the configured tags.
