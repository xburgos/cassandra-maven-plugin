Usage

  The plugin offers goals for updating the versions of artifacts referenced in
  a Maven <<<pom.xml>>> file.

* Basic Usage

  Maven 2.0 does not currently support re-reading modifications of the <<<pom.xml>>> within one invocation of Maven.

  The following goals:

    * {{{update-child-modules-mojo.html}versions:update-child-modules}}

    * {{{update-parent-mojo.html}versions:update-parent}}

    * {{{update-properties-mojo.html}versions:update-properties}}

  modify the <<<pom.xml>>> file, you need to run these goals separately from any other goals or life-cycle phases.

** Updating the parent version (Note: modifies <<<pom.xml>>> files)

  To update the parent version of your POM to the latest available, just invoke the <<<update-parent>>> goal.

---
mvn versions:update-parent
---

  {{{examples/update-parent.html} A more detailed example of the <<<update-parent>>> goal}}.

** Fixing a multi-module build (Note: modifies <<<pom.xml>>> files)

  If you have a multi-module build where the aggregator pom (i.e. the one with packaging of <<<pom>>> and the
  <<<modules>>> section) is also the parent referenced by its child modules, and the aggregator version does not
  match the version specified in the parent section of the child modules, Maven will not let you build the project.
  To fix all the child modules, use the {{{update-child-modules-mojo.html}versions:update-child-modules}} goal and invoke
  Maven in non-recursive mode.

---
mvn -N versions:update-child-modules
---

  {{{examples/update-child-modules.html} A more detailed example of the <<<update-child-modules>>> goal}}.


** Checking for new versions of plugins

  To get information about newer versions of plugins that you are using in your build, just invoke the
  <<<display-plugin-updates>>> goal.

---
mvn versions:display-plugin-updates
---

  {{{examples/display-plugin-updates.html} A more detailed example of the <<<display-plugin-updates>>> goal}}.

** Checking for new versions of dependencies

  To get information about newer versions of dependencies that you are using in your build, just invoke the
  <<<display-dependency-updates>>> goal.

---
mvn versions:display-dependency-updates
---

  {{{examples/display-dependency-updates.html} A more detailed example of the <<<display-dependency-updates>>> goal}}.

** Updating versions specified by properties (Note: modifies <<<pom.xml>>> files)

  This goal helps when you use properties to define versions.  Please see the
  {{{examples/update-properties.html}<<<update-properties>>> example}}.
