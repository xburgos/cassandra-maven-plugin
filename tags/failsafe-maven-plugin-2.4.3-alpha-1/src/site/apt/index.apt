Failsafe Maven Plugin

  The Failsafe Plugin is a fork of the Surefire plugin designed to run integration tests. The name was chosen
  for both because it is a synonym of surefire and because it implies that when it fails, it does so in a safe
  way.

  The Maven lifecycle has four phases for running integration tests:

  * <<<pre-integration-test>>> for setting up the integration test environment.

  * <<<integration-test>>> for running the integration tests.

  * <<<post-integration-test>>> for tearing down the integration test environment.

  * <<<verify>>> for checking the results of the integration tests.

  []

  If you use the Surefire Plugin for running tests, then when you have a test failure, the build will stop at the
  <<<integration-test>>> phase and your integration test environment will not have been torn down correctly.

  The Failsafe Plugin is used during the <<<integration-test>>> and <<<verify>>> phases of the build
  lifecycle to execute the integration tests of an application. The Failsafe Plugin will not fail the build during
  the <<<integration-test>>> phase thus enabling the <<<post-integration-test>>> phase to execute.

  NOTE: when running integration tests, you should invoke maven with the (shorter to type too)

+---+
mvn verify
+---+

  rather than trying to invoke the <<<integration-test>>> phase directly, as otherwise the <<<post-integration-test>>>
  phase will not be executed.

  The Failsafe Plugin generates reports in 2 different file formats:

  * Plain text files (*.txt)

  * XML files (*.xml)

  []

  By default, these files are generated at <<<$\{basedir\}/target/failsafe-reports>>>.

  For an HTML format of the report, please see the
  {{{http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-surefire-report-plugin/}Maven Surefire Report Plugin}}.

* Goals Overview

  The Failsafe Plugin has only 2 goals:

  * {{{integration-test-mojo.html}failsafe:integration-test}} runs the integration tests of an application.

  * {{{verify-mojo.html}failsafe:verify}} verifies that the integration tests of an application passed.
