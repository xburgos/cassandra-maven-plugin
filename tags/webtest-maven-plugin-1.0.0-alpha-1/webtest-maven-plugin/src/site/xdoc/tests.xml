            <p>The webtest-maven-plugin comes with a couple of integration test to show various feature
                of the plugin. This page gives you an overview of the features covered by the regression
                tests.

                        less verbose output. The test reflects a "classic" (i.e. ANT based) webtest script by
                        including entity references to externalize the configuration. Just run "mvn clean site"
                        and check the webtest report (we expect one test to fail).
