    <faq id="multiple rpms">
        <question>How can I provide multiple rpms (i.e. different architectures) from one project (pom)?</question>
        <answer>
            <p>
                Set the <i>packaging</i> type to <i>pom</i> and use multiple executions
                of the <a href="attached-rpm-mojo.html">attached-rpm</a> goal.<br/>
                In each execution, you need to define a unique
                <a href="attached-rpm-mojo.html#classifier">classifier</a>.
