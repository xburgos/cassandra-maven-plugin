Upgrading from 2.6 version to 2.7 (not yet released)

 There are a few significant incompatible changes introduced in 2.7's version of
NBM packaging lifecycle. The result should be faster builds and more freedom in customizing the builds.


   * The NBM file is currently not built by default. You need to explicitly invoke nbm:nbm goal to create the NBM file.
Alternatively you can attach the nbm:nbm goal to the packaging phase.

   * Before creating the cluster(s) of modules via the nbm:cluster goal, you need to invoke nbm:directory to
 create the actual NetBeans specific directory setup in the project's target/nbm folder. The nbm:cluster goal then merges these
directories into a single directory. The nbm:directory goal can be attached to the 
packaging phase (see above for example)

   * TBD
