Netbeans Freeform Maven Plugin

  This plugin is for generating a Netbeans project from a Maven 2 project.

  The Netbeans IDE 4.x (http://www.netbeans.org) defines a project type called 
  freeform. The Freeform project type in Netbeans is a Java project using the
  source tree you define. It uses an Ant script to call the Ant targets given with
  the Java sources.

  This plugin take the POM of a Maven project and its tree to create the two
  files needed by Netbeans to view a directory as a Freeform project. These files
  are the Netbeans project descriptor and the Ant build file.
