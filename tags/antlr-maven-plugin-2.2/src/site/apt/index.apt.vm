${project.name}

 The Antlr Plugin uses the parser generator {{{http://www.antlr2.org/}Antlr v2}}. For more information
 about Antlr v2, please refer to {{{http://www.antlr2.org/doc/index.html}Antlr v2 Reference Manual}}.

 Refer to {{{./dependencies.html}Project Dependencies}} to know the Antlr version used by the Plugin.

 <<Note>>: This plugin is for <<Antlr v2 only>>. For an <<Antlr v3 version>>,
 see the {{{http://mojo.codehaus.org/antlr3-maven-plugin/}antlr3-maven-plugin}}.

* Goals Overview

   The Antlr Plugin has two goals:

   * {{{./generate-mojo.html}antlr:generate}} Generates file(s) to a target directory based on grammar file(s).

   * {{{./html-mojo.html}antlr:html}} Generates Antlr report for grammar file(s).

* Usage

  General instructions on how to use the Plugin Name can be found on the {{{./usage.html}usage page}}. Some more
  specific use cases are described in the examples given below. Last but not least, users occasionally contribute
  additional examples, tips or errata to the
  {{{http://docs.codehaus.org/display/MAVENUSER/Antlr+Plugin}plugin's wiki page}}.

  In case you still have questions regarding the plugin's usage, please have a look at the {{{./faq.html}FAQ}} and feel
  free to contact the {{{./mail-lists.html}user mailing list}}. The posts to the mailing list are archived and could
  already contain the answer to your question as part of an older thread. Hence, it is also worth browsing/searching
  the {{{./mail-lists.html}mail archive}}.

  If you feel like the plugin is missing a feature or has a defect, you can fill a feature request or bug report in our
  {{{./issue-tracking.html}issue tracker}}. When creating a new issue, please provide a comprehensive description of your
  concern. Especially for fixing bugs it is crucial that the developers can reproduce your problem. For this reason,
  entire debug logs, POMs or most preferably little demo projects attached to the issue are very much appreciated.
  Of course, patches are welcome, too. Contributors can check out the project from our
  {{{./source-repository.html}source repository}} and will find supplementary information in the
  {{{http://maven.apache.org/guides/development/guide-helping.html}guide to helping with Maven}}.
