Usage

  The plugin offers goals for updating the versions of artifacts referenced in
  a Maven <<<pom.xml>>> file.

* Basic Usage

  Maven 2.0 does not currently support re-reading modifications of the <<<pom.xml>>> within one invocation of Maven.
  As the {{{update-parent-mojo.html}versions:update-parent}} and {{{update-properties-mojo.html}versions:update-properties}} goals
  modify the <<<pom.xml>>> file, you need to run these goals separately from any other goals or life-cycle phases.

** Updating the parent version

  To update the parent version of your POM to the latest available, just invoke the <<<update-parent>>> goal.

---
mvn versions:update-parent
---

  {{{examples/update-parent.html} A more detailed example of the <<<update-parent>>> goal}}.

** Checking for new versions of plugins

  To get information about newer versions of plugins that you are using in your build, just invoke the
  <<<display-plugin-updates>>> goal.

---
mvn versions:display-plugin-updates
---

  {{{examples/display-plugin-updates.html} A more detailed example of the <<<display-plugin-updates>>> goal}}.

** Checking for new versions of dependencies

  To get information about newer versions of dependencies that you are using in your build, just invoke the
  <<<display-dependency-updates>>> goal.

---
mvn versions:display-dependency-updates
---

  {{{examples/display-dependency-updates.html} A more detailed example of the <<<display-dependency-updates>>> goal}}.

** Updating versions specified by properties

  This goal helps when you use properties to define versions.  Please see the
  {{{examples/update-properties.html}<<<update-properties>>> example}}.
