      <p>
        The unix-maven-plugin is a Maven plugin for producing installation packages for UNIX platforms.
      </p>
      <p>
        The current release is 1.0-alpha-1. This release is meant as a technology preview release. The plugin is useful
        but work is in progress to make sure it support even more use cases. The documentation is currently lacking,
        but the integration tests currently act as the documentation.
      </p>
      <p>
        See the <a href="http://svn.codehaus.org/mojo/trunk/mojo/unix/TODO.txt">TODO.txt</a> for the latest status
        on supported cases and planned features. See the
        <a href="http://svn.codehaus.org/mojo/trunk/mojo/unix/unix-maven-plugin/src/it/README.txt">README.txt</a> in
        the integration test directory for an explanation of the different integration tests.
      </p>
      <subsection name="Highlights">
        <p>
          The plugin currently support the following packaging formats and platforms:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <code>dpkg</code> - Debian and Debian-based platforms like Ubuntu
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>pkg</code> - Platforms with System V packaging tools like Solaris and HP-UX. Only Solaris is tested.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>rpm</code> - RedHat, Fedora and other platforms using RPM. Many platforms have RPM even if they use
            another format as their primary format.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Other features
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>

-->
          </li>
<!-- Not implemented yet
          <li>
