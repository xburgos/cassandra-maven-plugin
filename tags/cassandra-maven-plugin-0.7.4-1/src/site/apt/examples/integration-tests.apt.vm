Integration tests

  The aim here is to combine the usage of the <<<cassandra-maven-plugin>>> with the <<<maven-failsafe-plugin>>> to
  allow the integration tests to be run against a test instance of Apache Cassandra. The developer does not have to manually
  install Cassandra.

  First we need to modify the <<<pom.xml>>> to reference both <<<cassandra-maven-plugin>>> and the
  <<<maven-failsafe-plugin>>>

<project>
  ...
  <build>
    ...
    <plugins>
      ...
      <plugin>
        <artifactId>maven-failsafe-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>2.7.1</version>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <goals>
              <goal>integration-test</goal>
              <goal>verify</goal>
            </goals>
          </execution>
        </executions>
      </plugin>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>
        <artifactId>cassandra-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <goals>
              <goal>start</goal>
              <goal>stop</goal>
            </goals>
          </execution>
        </executions>
      </plugin>

  </build>

  This will result in the following mojos being executed during the lifecycle as follows:

*-----------------------+---------------------------------+
| <<Phase>>             | <<Goal(s)>>                     |
*-----------------------+---------------------------------+
| pre-integration-test  | cassandra:start                 |
*-----------------------+---------------------------------+
| integration-test      | failsafe:integration-test       |
*-----------------------+---------------------------------+
| post-integration-test | cassandra:stop                  |
*-----------------------+---------------------------------+
| verify                | failsafe:verify                 |
*-----------------------+---------------------------------+

  If you want the tests to be more independent, you can leverage the <<<build-helper-maven-plugin>>> to allocate
  random ports to your tests, thereby ensuring that the tests don't fail if a port is in use, and allowing, e.g.
  parallel builds on a build server.

  For example (Note this example assumes you use resource filtering to pass the cassandra ports through to the tests,
  you could also pass them through as system properties by configuring <<<maven-failsafe-plugin>>>):
