Build-on-Demand, RPM Artifact Resolver Consolidation :: Functional Steps

1. Resolve dependency POMs (do NOT search for binaries here)

2. Order dependency POMs

3. If mode == BUILD_ON_DEMAND || mode == BINARIES_ONLY, then resolve RPMs:

   A. If RPM is installed in RPM db, use that to constrain any dependency version
      ranges.
      
   B. If RPM is not installed, but can be resolved in the repository system,
      install it in the RPM db.
      
   C. If RPM is not installed in the RPM db, and cannot be resolved, cache it in
      a failed-binary-check List (maintain original order relative to others 
      that land in the same list).
      
4A. If mode == BUILD_ON_DEMAND || mode == SOURCE_ONLY, go through the 
    failed-binary-check List, and build each one.
    
    NOTE: What about using/not using the RPM --force option on this? What if
    mode == BUILD_ON_DEMAND, and the version of the dependency installed in the
    RPM db is not compatible with the one requested? Two versions of a single
    dependency cannot coexist in the RPM db. What if mode == SOURCE_ONLY, and 
    the dependency is already installed in the RPM db?
    
4B. If mode == BINARIES_ONLY, stop the build, citing the failed dependencies
