Web application configuration

 When developing a web application you probably want the generated CSS files to be included in the war.
 This can be configured by changing the <<<outputDirectory>>> configuration:

+-----+
<project>
  ...
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>
        <artifactId>lesscss-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <configuration>
          <outputDirectory>${project.build.directory}/${project.build.finalName}/css</outputDirectory>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
      ...
    </plugins>
  </build>
  ...
</project>
+-----+

 When you want to compile the LESS sources client side in development mode (see {{http://lesscss.org/#-client-side-usage}}), 
 you want the sources to be located in your <code>webapp</code> directory to include them in your web pages.\
 This can be configured by changing the <<<sourceDirectory>>> configuration:

+-----+
<project>
  ...
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>
        <artifactId>lesscss-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <configuration>
          <sourceDirectory>${project.basedir}/src/main/webapp/less</sourceDirectory>
          <outputDirectory>${project.build.directory}/${project.build.finalName}/css</outputDirectory>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
      ...
    </plugins>
  </build>
  ...
</project>
