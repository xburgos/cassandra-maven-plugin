        The unix-maven-plugin is a Maven plugin for producing installation packages for UNIX platforms.
      </p>
      <p>
        The current release is <b>1.0-alpha-3</b>. This release is meant as a technology preview release. The plugin
        is useful but work is in progress to make sure it support even more use cases. The documentation is currently
        a bit slim but more is coming. The integration tests act as example projects for now.
      </p>
      <p>
        See the <a href="http://svn.codehaus.org/mojo/trunk/mojo/unix/TODO.txt">TODO.txt</a> for the latest status
        on supported cases and planned features. See the
        <a href="http://svn.codehaus.org/mojo/trunk/mojo/unix/unix-maven-plugin/src/it/README.txt">README.txt</a> in
        the integration test directory for an explanation of the different integration tests.

          The plugin currently support the following packaging formats and platforms:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <code>dpkg</code> - Debian and Debian-based platforms like Ubuntu
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>pkg</code> - Platforms with System V packaging tools like Solaris and HP-UX. Only Solaris is tested.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>rpm</code> - RedHat, Fedora and other platforms using RPM. Many platforms have RPM even if they use
            another format as their primary format.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Other features
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>

          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Repository index generation</b>: Goals for running dpkg-scanpackages

-->
          </li>
<!-- Not implemented yet
          <li>
            Optional compression of packages. Only applicable for the PKG format as DPKG and RPM automatically
            compress the data files.
          </li>
