    <section name="Developing the Solaris Maven Plugin">
      <p>
        This document describes how to work on the Unix Maven plugin itself.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section name="Running the Integration Tests">
      <p>
        The plugin use the <a href="http://mojo.codehaus.org/shitty-maven-plugin/">Shitty</a> plugin to run the
        integration tests. To run the tests execute Maven with the <code>integration-tests</code> profile like this:
      </p>
      <source>mvn clean install -Pintegration-tests</source>
      <p>
        Note that this require <i>all</i> the packaging tools to be available for all platforms. If you only want to
        run a subset of the integration tests, use the "-Dits" setting like this: 
      </p>
      <source>mvn -Dits=test-dpkg-*/pom4test.xml integration-test</source>
    </section>
    <section name="Wanted Features">
      <subsection name="pkgmk/pkgtrans implemented in java">
        <p>
          By implementing the external tools required to create the System V packages it would be possible to use this
          plugin on all platforms.
        </p>
        <p>
          The pkg file format is basically a header describing all the packages (a package data stream can contain many
          packages) and a set of CPIO archives concatinated after each other.
