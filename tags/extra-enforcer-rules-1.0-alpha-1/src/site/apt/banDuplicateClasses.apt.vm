Ban Duplicate Classes

  This rule checks the dependencies and fails if any class is present in more than one dependency.

   The following parameters are supported by this rule:

   * ignoreClasses - a list of classes to ignore duplicates of. Wildcards can be specified using the * character.

   * findAllDuplicates - a boolean to indicate whether the rule should find all duplicates or fail fast at the first duplicate. Defaults to false.

   * message - an optional message to provide when duplicates are found.
