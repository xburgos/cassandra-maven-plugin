Advanced Parameters

  The parameters described in this page are parameters which enable advanced
  RPM features.  Before using these parameters, it is <<highly>> recommended
  that you read {{{http://www.rpm.org/max-rpm/}Maximum RPM}} to gain an
  understanding of what these parameters do.

* RPM Package {Dependency} Management

  <<These parameters relate to the dependencies between RPM packages, not to
  the dependencies required to build the RPM package contents.>>

  There are three RPM spec file tags related to dependency management:

    * <<<provides>>> defines a <virtual package> which is provided
      by the package being built
 
    * <<<requires>>> identifies a package that is required to be installed for
      the package being built to operate correctly

    * <<<conflicts>>> identifies a package which must not be installed if the
      package being built is installed

  All three of these tags can appear multiple times in the spec file.  To
  configure these tags in the plugin configuration, specify an element for
  each instance of the tag in the spec file; the content of the element is the
  exact text to be placed in the spec file.  Please be careful to ensure that
  version comparison specifications such as <<< < >>> and <<< > >>> are
  properly specified in the XML file.  Here is an example:

+-----+
<provides>
    <provide>dump</provide>
</provides>
<requires>
    <require>trash-truck &gt; 1.0</require>
</requires>
<conflicts>
    <conflict>incinerator</conflict>
</conflicts>
+-----+

* {Relocation}

  If you specify the <<<prefix>>> parameter to the RPM plugin, you can create
  a package that can be installed in a user-specified location.  Before doing
  this, read and understand Maximum RPM
  {{{http://www.rpm.org/max-rpm/ch-rpm-reloc.html}Chapter 15}} since there are
  a number of kinks and quirks that must be addressed.

* {Scripts}

  There are a number of scripts that can be included in the RPM package which
  are executed as part of the installation, removal, or verification of the
  package.  For each of these scripts, there are two plugin parameters:  one
  with the script ID (for example, "<<<preinstall>>>") which holds the actual
  script, and one with the script ID followed by "<<<Script>>>" (for example,
  "<<<preinstallScript>>>") which has the name of the file containing the
  script.  If both parameters are specified for a script, the external file
  will be ignored.  Before writing scripts for RPM packages, understand the
  {{{http://www.rpm.org/max-rpm/s1-rpm-inside-scripts.html}script docs}} in
  Maximum RPM since the operation of the scripts must be done correctly or
  major problems can occur while installing or removing the package.

** <<<preinstall>>>

  This script is run before the package is installed.  It corresponds to the
  <<<%pre>>> tag in the spec file.
  
** <<<install>>>

  This script is run as a part of installing the package.  It corresponds to the
  <<<%install>>> tag in the spec file.

** <<<postinstall>>>

  This script is run after the package is installed.  It corresponds to the
  <<<%post>>> tag in the spec file.

** <<<preremove>>>

  This script is run before the package is removed.  It corresponds to the
  <<<%preun>>> tag in the spec file.

** <<<postremove>>>

  This script is run after the package is removed.  It corresponds to the
  <<<%postun>>> tag in the spec file.

** <<<verify>>>

  This script is run when the package is being verified.  It corresponds to
  the <<<%verifyScript>>> tag in the spec file.
  
** <<<clean>>>

  This script is run after the package is installed to clean up installation files.  It corresponds to the
  <<<%clean>>> tag in the spec file.
